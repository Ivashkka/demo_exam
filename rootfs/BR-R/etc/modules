# /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf: kernel modules to load at boot time.
#
# This file should contain the names of kernel modules that are
# to be loaded at boot time, one per line.  Comments begin with
# a `#', and everything on the line after them are ignored.

# This reads all module names listed in /etc/modules-load.d/?*.conf and
# loads them into the kernel. This follows roughly Debian's way to
# handle modules, but uses a directory of fragments instead of a
# single /etc/modules file. */
